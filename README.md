# Festive-Campaign-Analysis

# Project Description:

AtliQ Mart is a retail giant with over 50 supermarkets in the southern region of India. All their 50 stores ran a massive promotion during the Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024 (festive time in India) on their AtliQ branded products. Now the sales director wants to understand which promotions did well and which did not so that they can make informed decisions for their next promotional period.

Sales director Bruce Haryali wanted this immediately but the analytics manager Tony is engaged on another critical project. Tony decided to give this work to Peter Pandey who is the curious data analyst of AtliQ Mart. Since these insights will be directly reported to the sales director, Tony also provided some notes to Peter to support his work.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data obtained from AtliQ Mart's internal databases. The main datasets used include fact_events, dim_products, dim_stores, and sales_summary. These datasets contain information about product sales, store locations, promotional events, and campaign revenues.

## Project Overview

1.Analyzed data from AtliQ Mart's internal databases.
2.Performed SQL queries to fulfill five business requests.
3.Insights are intended to inform future promotional strategies and resource allocation.


## Results and Insights

The analysis revealed several key insights:

High-value products featured in 'BOGOF' promotions.
Distribution of stores across different cities.
Total revenue generated before and after each promotional campaign.
Incremental sold quantity and revenue percentage during the Diwali campaign.
Top 5 products ranked by incremental revenue percentage.
These insights can help AtliQ Mart make informed decisions for future promotional activities, optimize resource allocation, and improve overall sales performance.


## Conclusion
Overall, the analysis provides valuable insights into the performance of promotional campaigns conducted by AtliQ Mart during Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024. By leveraging data analytics, AtliQ Mart can enhance its marketing strategies, attract more customers, and drive higher sales during festive seasons.
